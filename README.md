README for express_todo

'npm start' from the root directory to run and the app will be accessible at localhost:3000

This was my first full stack javascript project and it was mostly done as a learning experience. It relies on Parse, which is closing down later this year, but is still up as of now (June 2016). The app uses the following:

Express.js - MVC Node.js based web framework, with a lightweight server. Also used for routing.
Parse - Used for user registration, login, logout, and persisting data.
Backbone.js - Used for modeling data received from Parse on the client side.
ejs - Templating language used in Views.
